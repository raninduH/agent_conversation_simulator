Glad you like them.\"\nJason: \"Cinnamon and banana, huh? Not bad, Mom. Not bad at all.\" (I finish off the stack.) \"So, you feeling strong enough to arm wrestle or what?\" (I smirk, nudging her playfully.)\nSarah: (I stiffen slightly, a nervous laugh escaping me.) \"Arm wrestle? Oh, I don't know about that, Jason. I'm sure you'd win. Besides, I have dishes to do.\" (I turn towards the sink, avoiding eye contact.)\nJason: \"Come on, Mom, don't be a chicken. It'll be fun. Just one quick match. I bet I can still take you, even with your 'consistent' gym routine.\" (I flex my own bicep, trying to look confident.)\nSarah: (I peek at him over my shoulder, a mischievous glint in my eyes.) \"Oh, you *think* so, do you? I wouldn't want to embarrass you, sweetie.\" (I giggle, grabbing a dishtowel and pretending to wipe down the counter.)\nJason: \"Embarrass *me*? Please. I'm the one who's gonna be embarrassed when you throw your back out trying to beat me.\" (I clear a space on the table, ready for the arm wrestle.) \"Come on, Mom. Let's do this.\"\nSarah: (I sigh dramatically, placing the dishtowel down.) \"Oh, alright, alright. But don't come crying to me when you lose.\" (I walk over to the table, a playful smile on my face. I sit down, positioning my arm, but keep my strength hidden.) \"Ready to eat your words?\"\nJason: (I grin, locking my hand with hers, my elbow on the table.) \"Born ready. On three? One... two... three!\" (I strain, putting all my effort into pushing her arm down.)\nSarah: (I let him push a little, making it seem like he's actually putting up a fight. I'm using just enough strength to make it seem challenging, but I could easily win. I grunt a little, pretending to struggle.) \"Oh, you're... stronger than I thought!\" (I'm enjoying this a little too much.)\nJason: (I'm grunting with effort, sweat starting to bead on my forehead. \"Yeah, well... years of carrying your groceries... has its advantages!\" I'm putting everything I have into this, convinced I'm about to win.)\nSarah: (I decide to give him a little scare. With a sudden burst of controlled power, I slam his arm down on the table. It's over in a split second.) \"Oops! Did I win?\" (I try to look surprised, but there's a definite smirk playing on my lips.)\nJason: (My eyes widen in shock as my arm slams against the table. I stare at her, dumbfounded.) \"What... what just happened? That's... not possible.\" (I shake my head, trying to process what just occurred.)\nSarah: (I shrug innocently, flexing my bicep subtly. It's bigger than it was a few months ago, that's for sure.) \"Maybe those protein pancakes are working better than I thought. Want to feel my bicep?\" (I hold out my arm, trying to suppress a giggle.)\nJason: (I hesitate for a moment, still reeling from the arm wrestling defeat, then cautiously reach out and gently squeeze her bicep. My eyes widen again.) \"Whoa... Mom, you're ripped! What have you been doing at the gym?\" (I'm genuinely impressed and a little intimidated.)\nSarah: (I let him feel it for a moment, enjoying his stunned reaction. Then, I quickly snatch my arm away, grabbing his hand with surprising strength. I pull him close, whispering in a low, menacing voice.) \"Maybe... I've been working on something *special*.\" (I release his hand, stepping back and watching his reaction with a playful grin.)\nJason: (I stumble back, a shiver running down my spine. Her grip was surprisingly strong, and that whisper... it was genuinely unsettling.) \"Uh... special? What do you mean, special?\" (I look around nervously, suddenly feeling very small.)\nSarah: (I maintain the serious expression for a few more seconds, then burst out laughing.) \"Just kidding, Jason! You should see your face! I just meant I've been learning some self-defense moves. You never know when you might need them.\" (I'm practically doubled over with laughter now.)\nJason: (I let out a nervous chuckle, trying to play it cool, but my heart is still racing.) \"Self-defense moves, huh? Yeah, that's... that's good. Good for you.\" (I back away slowly, keeping my eyes on her.) \"I think I'll just... go do some dishes.\"\nSarah: (I wipe a tear from my eye, still chuckling.) \"Alright, sweetie. You do that. And maybe next time, think twice before challenging your old mom to an arm wrestle.\" (I wink, returning to the stove, but the mischievous glint in my eyes is still there. The prank is far from over.)\nJason: (I grab a plate and start scrubbing, trying to avoid eye contact. I can feel her watching me, and I can't shake the feeling that something else is coming. I decide to play it safe and keep my head down.) \"Yeah, lesson learned, Mom. Lesson learned.\" (I scrub extra hard, hoping to disappear into the task.)\nSarah: (I hum to myself as I continue cooking, occasionally glancing over at Jason with a knowing smile. I decide to ramp up the prank a little. Casually, I pick up a heavy cast iron skillet with one hand, tossing it lightly in the air before setting it back down.) \"These skillets are getting heavy. Maybe I should start using the lighter ones.\" (I say it loud enough for him to hear, but pretend I'm not paying attention to his reaction.)\nJason: (I almost drop the plate I'm washing, hearing the clatter of the skillet. I glance over, my eyes widening as I see her casually tossing the heavy pan. \"Mom... be careful with that! You'll break something... or someone.\")\nSarah: (I feign surprise, looking at him with wide, innocent eyes.) \"Oh, relax, Jason. I've got it. It's not like it weighs a ton.\" (I lift the skillet again, holding it out with one hand and flexing my bicep slightly.) \"See? No problem.\" (I hold the pose for a few seconds, then gently place the skillet back down, turning back to the stove.) \"Maybe I should start entering weightlifting competitions... what do you think?\" (I say it with a completely straight face.)",
